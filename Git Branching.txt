3. Git Branching - Branches in a Nutshell
    3.1. Creating a New Branch
            $ git branch testing // Here creating a new branch called testing
            $ git log --oneline --decorate // shows you where the branch pointers are pointing. This option is called --decorate
            $ git branch // To see local branch name
            $ git branch -r // To see remote branch name
            $ git branch -a // To see all branch name
            $ git branch -d // branch_name To delete branch
            $ git branch -D // branch_name To delete branch forcefully
    3.2. Switching Branches
            $ git checkout testing // This moves HEAD to point to the testing branch.
            $ git checkout -b testing // Create a branch and move to testing branch instantly
